# Web Scraping and Element Style Finder

This Python script allows you to scrape a website for specific HTML elements and their associated CSS styles. It uses the `requests` library to send a GET request to the website and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing the HTML content.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:


5. Follow the on-screen prompts:

- Enter the URL of the website you want to scrape.
- Specify the HTML tags you want to select (e.g., div, span, h1).
- Specify the CSS style you want to find (e.g., color, font-size).

6. The script will then send a request to the specified URL, scrape the content, and display the selected elements with the specified style.
